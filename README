There are 30 total runs that need to be completed. Six different cpu amounts
(1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30) and five runs for each cpu amount. The script will add one
submission per run to qstat. Once your runs are complete a file will appear for
each run in your directory. Running the 'combine' script will combine all of 
those files into a single one.

YOU MUST EDIT THE 'RUN' SCRIPT
You have to replace three things in the script. 
REPLACE_JOB_NAME needs to be whatever you want your jobs to show up in qstat.
REPLACE_NUMBER needs to be your account number. Make sure to leave the 'jch-s'
REPLACE_EXECUTABLE_NAME needs to be... the name of your executable.

The script 'submit' takes two flages. The first one is either -long or -short, 
or -all.
-long will do the runs for 1 and 2 cores.
-short will do the runs for 5, 10, 20, and 30 cores.
-all will do the runs for all six core counts.
The second flag needs to be a number between 1 and 5 (inclusive). This number
will decide how many runs to do for each amount. For example:
./submit -all 5
will do all 30 necessary runs.

WARNING:
Every time you run 'submit' it will remove all *.o* files which will get rid of
all your results if you have not yet combined them using the 'combine' script.
